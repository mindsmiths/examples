# Hi, I'm Felix, your workout buddy! 

Felix gathers information about the user and their workout preferences. With Felix, you can build onboarding screens, create a short survey for user profiling, and try out a bunch of different armory components.

# Are we doing this or what?

## Prerequisites
To set the initial state of the project just run `forge init`. This will install prerequisites and build the project.

You'll also need to install armory.

`pip install armory~=5.1.0`

`armory setup`

This latter command will prompt you to:

1. Choose the agent handling signals coming from Armory
2. Provide the Armory site URL, which you'll use to access Armory

As for the URL, you just use your environment URL (e.g. http://workspace-ms-XXXXXXXXXX.sandbox.mindsmiths.io) with the XXXXXXXXXX being the digits you have in your web IDE link. The URL will automatically be saved in your .env file, where you can find it at any moment.

## Get ready to rumble!
This should be enough to get you started! You can find tutorial for Felix at https://docs.mindsmiths.com/docs/tutorials/web-interactions/introduction. 

To start playing, just run `forge run`. 

Have fun!
