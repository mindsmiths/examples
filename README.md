# Mindsmiths Platform Examples

In this directory you can find a number of examples of how you can use the Mindsmiths platform to create intelligent solutions.

After pulling the repo, just navigate to the root of the project you want to run in the terminal (e.g. `cd nola/`) and run `forge init` to configure everything for running that demo. Each directory contains a small README on how to run the code.

More contributions welcome!
